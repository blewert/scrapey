# GUI Applications
There are two GUI applications packaged with scrapey:

- `analysis-gui`: Used for some basic analysis of scraped data. (still in development)
- `scrapey-gui`: A GUI for running scrapey on multiple sources. It is advised that if you do not want to use the command-line, you can use this utility. (still in development)
