# What is this?
Scrapey is a tool for scraping and searching data from the following sources:

- Steam reviews (globally)
- Twitter
- Reddit

Scrapey provides historical searches as well as a live streaming utility for data. These can be specified through the command-line parameters when ran. Scrapey also comes with some text analysis tools to analyse your data.

# This all seems very complicated...
Scrapey comes packaged with two GUI applications if you don't really understand how to use the command-line interface. The first is a tool which you can use for scraping, and the second is a tool you can use for the analysis of data.
